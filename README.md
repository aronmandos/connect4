**Connect4** 

This application runs a webserver for playing Connect4 on.

Website:
accessable on root


RESTfull API:
URL: root/api
Swagger2 api docs: root/v2/api-docs

****build**** 

until i figure out why angular wont build on auto:
first build project as defined in maven (IDE -> build)
then in terminal in root folder run: "ng build"


****to do later****

*prio*
basic UI
logic to make moves
UI to display field
UI to make move as a certain player (like a select box)
logic to determine win
UI for whole playing games process
auth for logging in
using auth to determine player


*non prio*

find out why maven build wont run ng build execution like i defined.
find a fix for swagger-ui.html not working.
